Bar plot of the top items bought in the 5 most popular departments:

```{r}
top_department = instacart %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(5)

product_list = instacart %>%
  filter(department %in% top_department$department) %>%
  group_by(department, product_name) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  top_n(n = 5)

instacart_sample = instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% product_list$product_name)

product_list %>%
  mutate(product_name = fct_reorder(product_name, n)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~product_name, y = ~n, color = ~product_name, type = "bar") %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'Number of orders'))
```


Boxplot of hour of day of when products were bought per day of week:

```{r}
instacart %>%
  mutate(order_dow = factor(order_dow),
         order_dow = recode(order_dow, "0" = "Sun", "1" = "Mon", "2" = "Tues", 
                            "3" = "Wed", "4" = "Thurs", "5" = "Fri", "6" = "Sat")
  ) %>%
  plot_ly(y = ~order_hour_of_day, color = ~order_dow, type = "box") %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = "Hour of day"))
